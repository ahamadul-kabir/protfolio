            <h1> Web Development</h1>
            <p>
                Web development is the process of building websites and applications for the internet, or for a private network known as an intranet. Web development is not concerned with the design of a website; rather, it’s all about the coding and programming that powers the website’s functionality.</p>

                The main goal of my system is not only to make a bridge between the tour agency and their desired customers but also make the traveling of the tourist community a hassle-free and worthy one. I planned to make a system for the web that will help the users to connect in the simplest way and tour agencies can make their new business way. In a nutshell, I can simply say that it will change the way of thinking about the tourism industry and take it to a new level.
